# SiTa: A Speaker Diarization Dataset

[![CC BY-NC 4.0][cc-by-nc-shield]][cc-by-nc]

**SiTa** is a speaker diarization dataset featuring multispeaker audio clips in Sinhala and Tamil. It is designed to support research in speaker diarization and related audio processing tasks. The dataset consists of two subsets: one for Sinhala and another for Tamil, containing 10 hours of Sinhala audio and 2 hours of Tamil audio. All audio clips are provided in WAV format at 16kHz, along with Rich Transcription Time Marked (RTTM) files for speaker diarization annotations. The dataset includes high-quality annotations to ensure accurate evaluation.

    abstract = "The dynamic field of speaker diarization continues to present significant challenges, despite notable advancements in recent years and the rising focus on complex acoustic scenarios emphasizes the importance of sustained research efforts in this area. While speech resources for speaker diarization are expanding rapidly, aided by semi-automated techniques, many existing datasets remain outdated and lack authentic real-world conversational data. This challenge is particularly acute for low-resource South Asian languages, due to limited public media data and reduced research efforts. Sinhala and Tamil are two such languages with limited speaker diarization datasets. To address this gap, we introduce a new speaker diarization dataset for these languages and evaluate multiple existing models to assess their performance. This work provides essential resources, a novel dataset and valuable insights from model benchmarks to advance speaker diarization for low-resource languages, particularly Sinhala and Tamil."
